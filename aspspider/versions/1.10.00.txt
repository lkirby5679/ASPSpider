	Main changes to form v 1.10.00
	
	In addition to these changes, we caught a number of small bugs.
	
	GENERAL
	=======
	
		* 	renamed several files to come into line with site procedure: "_NAME.ASP" for code, "NAME.ASP" for 
			visible files and updated links to those files
		
			- ADMIN/SPIDERINDEX/SPIDERCODE.ASP > _SPIDERCODE.ASP
			- ADMIN/SPIDERINDEX/DELETEURL.ASP > _DELETEURL.ASP
			
		*	created a new folder called CONFIG which contains the files which a user must config in order to 
			set the site to their own specs; to get a site up and running the site will only need to have files
			in this folder and the MEDIA folder changed (initially, at least); moved to this folder COMMON.ASP,
			META.ASP and STYLE.CSS which has a completely new style sheet for the site.
			
		*	Took look and feel from the individual files and placed them entirely in CSS.


	ADMIN/EDITPAGE.ASP
	==================

		New file to allow editing of individual pages within the DB.
